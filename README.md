# JSON Files for My Website

## links.json - Shared Links

A JSON file tracking my shared links. These links are shown on [my website](https://rardk.com/links/).

## lego-sets.json - Lego Sets List

A JSON file tracking my LEGO collection. This list is separated from [rardk-web](https://github.com/rarDevelopment/rardk-web) to allow for easier updates without deploying the entire site each time. You can see the collection reflected [here](https://www.rardk.com/lego/).
