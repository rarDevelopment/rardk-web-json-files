He led the production of innovative platforms such as the Nintendo DS and the Wii, and laid the groundwork for the development of the wildly successful Pokémon Go game and the Nintendo Switch.

In this motivational collection, Satoru Iwata addresses diverse subjects such as locating bottlenecks, how success breeds resistance to change, and why programmers should never say no.

For the past seven years, he's dedicated himself to studying the history of the instrument that's been so essential to his career, collecting hundreds of basses from around the globe.Written with arts journalist Daniel Richler, gorgeously photographed in breathtaking detail by Richard Sibbald, and with insight from Geddy’s trusted bass tech and curator, John ""Skully"" McIntosh, Geddy Lee’s Big Beautiful Book of Bass profiles over 250 classic basses from Geddy’s extensive collection.

Complete with personal commentary from Geddy that showcases his knowledge both as a musician and an aficionado, this luxuriously produced volume is a revelatory look at the heavy hitters in the world of bass—Fender, Gibson/Epiphone, Rickenbacker, Höfner, Ampeg—and lesser known but influential global luthiers such as Antonio Wandr Pioli, Dan Armstrong, and Tony Zemaitis.The book also features interviews with John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin); Adam Clayton (U2); Robert Trujillo (Metallica); Jeff Tweedy (Wilco); Bill Wyman (The Rolling Stones); Les Claypool (Primus); Bob Daisley (Rainbow); Fender expert and owner of the legendary Gibson Explorer, Bass Ken Collins; veteran guitar tech for The Who, Alan Rogan; plus comments from many other great players across three decades of rock and roll.Written in Geddy's singular voice, this book reveals the stories, songs, and history behind the instruments of his inimitable collection. Complete with an index and a graphically designed timeline of the history of the bass, as well as an up-close look at Geddy's basses on Rush's final R40 Tour, his stage and recording gear from 1968 to 2017, and forewords by author and respected vintage expert, Terry Foster, and Rush band member, Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee's Big Beautiful Book of Bass is the ultimate compendium for the consummate collector, musician, Rush fan, and anyone who loves the bass guitar.",,,,,,,,,,,408,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780062747846,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2024/09/05 00:12:15.830260038,,,,,,,,aJxrDwAAQBAJ,Physical Book,0,0,0,,,

The Dreamcast Encyclopedia,,Every Game Released for the Sega Dreamcast,,,Chris Scullion,"Scullion, Chris",,,,,,Pen & Sword Books Limited,,2023/09/04,2023,,,,Games & Activities,"A definitive guide to the Sega Dreamcast, the most underrated gaming systems of all time.The Dreamcast Encyclopedia is the fifth book in Scottish author and games journalist Chris Scullion's critically-acclaimed series of video game encyclopedias. The Sega Dreamcast is fondly remembered by players as a games console that was ahead of its time, almost to a fault. Its incredible graphics offered a level of detail that hadn't been seen on home systems to that point, and its built-in modem brought online multiplayer to many console players for the first time ever. Ultimately though, the release of the PS2 (and later the GameCube and Xbox) led to struggling sales and Sega would eventually pull the plug on the Dreamcast just two years into its life, bowing out of the console manufacturing business altogether. On paper the Dreamcast was a commercial failure, but those who owned one remember it so fondly that for many it remains one of the greatest games consoles of all time, with a small but well-formed library of high-quality games. This book contains every one of those games, including not only the entire western library of around 270 titles, but also the 340 or so games that were exclusively released in Japan. With over 600 games covered in total, screenshots for every title and a light-hearted writing style designed for an entertaining read, The Dreamcast Encyclopedia is the definitive guide to one of the most underrated gaming systems of all time.",,,,,,,,,,,280,,,,,,English,,,,,,9781526772237,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2024/08/27 00:51:22.497200965,,,,,,,,t22zzwEACAAJ,Physical Book,0,0,0,,,

The N64 Encyclopedia,,Every Game Released for the Nintendo 64,,,Chris Scullion,"Scullion, Chris",,,,,,Pen & Sword Books Limited,,,2022,,,,Games & Activities,"""Chris Scullion's latest console encyclopedia is possibly his best yet."" -- Retro Gamer  The fourth book in Chris Scullion's critically acclaimed series of video game encyclopedias, The N64 Encyclopedia is dedicated to the Nintendo 64, one of the most well-loved games consoles ever released. Although the Nintendo 64 didn't sell as well as some of Nintendo's other systems, and although it struggled in the shadow of the bold newcomer that was the Sony PlayStation, everyone who owned an N64 was in love with it and the four-player multiplayer it provided as standard. Despite its relatively small library, the Nintendo 64 had a healthy number of groundbreaking titles that would revolutionize the way we played video games. The likes of Super Mario 64, GoldenEye 007, Mario Kart 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time remain iconic in the eyes of video game fans 25 years down the line. This book naturally contains those games, but it also contains every other game released for the system, no matter how obscure. It also covers every game released in Japan, including those for the ill-fated Nintendo 64DD add-on which never left the country. With over 400 games covered, screenshots for every title and a light-hearted writing style designed to make reading it a fun experience, the N64 Encyclopedia is the definitive guide to a truly revolutionary gaming system.",,,,,,,,,,,256,,,,,,English,,,,,,9781526772183,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2024/08/27 00:51:22.493631005,,,,,,,,fInpzgEACAAJ,Physical Book,0,0,0,,,
