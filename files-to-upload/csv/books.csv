The Dreamcast Encyclopedia,,Every Game Released for the Sega Dreamcast,,,Chris Scullion,"Scullion, Chris",,,,,,Pen & Sword Books Limited,,2023/09/04,2023,,,,Games & Activities,"A definitive guide to the Sega Dreamcast, the most underrated gaming systems of all time.The Dreamcast Encyclopedia is the fifth book in Scottish author and games journalist Chris Scullion's critically-acclaimed series of video game encyclopedias. The Sega Dreamcast is fondly remembered by players as a games console that was ahead of its time, almost to a fault. Its incredible graphics offered a level of detail that hadn't been seen on home systems to that point, and its built-in modem brought online multiplayer to many console players for the first time ever. Ultimately though, the release of the PS2 (and later the GameCube and Xbox) led to struggling sales and Sega would eventually pull the plug on the Dreamcast just two years into its life, bowing out of the console manufacturing business altogether. On paper the Dreamcast was a commercial failure, but those who owned one remember it so fondly that for many it remains one of the greatest games consoles of all time, with a small but well-formed library of high-quality games. This book contains every one of those games, including not only the entire western library of around 270 titles, but also the 340 or so games that were exclusively released in Japan. With over 600 games covered in total, screenshots for every title and a light-hearted writing style designed for an entertaining read, The Dreamcast Encyclopedia is the definitive guide to one of the most underrated gaming systems of all time.",,,,,,,,,,,280,,,,,,English,,,,,,9781526772237,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2024/08/27 00:51:22.497200965,,,,,,,,t22zzwEACAAJ,Physical Book,0,0,0,,,

Every day I clean the Winchesters' beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.    I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew's handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it's hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina's life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.    I only try on one of Nina's pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it's like. But she soon finds out... and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it's far too late.    But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don't know who I really am.

Although the Nintendo 64 didn't sell as well as some of Nintendo's other systems, and although it struggled in the shadow of the bold newcomer that was the Sony PlayStation, everyone who owned an N64 was in love with it and the four-player multiplayer it provided as standard. Despite its relatively small library, the Nintendo 64 had a healthy number of groundbreaking titles that would revolutionize the way we played video games. The likes of Super Mario 64, GoldenEye 007, Mario Kart 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time remain iconic in the eyes of video game fans 25 years down the line.
