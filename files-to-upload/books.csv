The Unofficial NES/Famicom,,A Visual Compendium,,,"Steve Jarratt,Damien McFerran","Jarratt, Steve",,,,,,Bitmap Books,,,2017,,,,,"""With its cutting edge graphics and extensive catalogue of iconic games, the NES/Famicom played a huge part in the history of videogaming. Nintendo's console stormed onto the market and immediately raised the bar with classic titles such as Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem and many more.

For many, this would be a turning point in their lives, leading them to become artists, game designers and programmers. It helped to popularise manga and anime among Western gamers, and brought icons of Western culture into Japanese homes. Nintendos little 8-bit console changed the world of entertainment forever, and its influence cannot be overstated. NES/Famicom: a visual compendium aims to showcase the very best pixel art, box art and product design on each system. Spread over 536 pages, it features more than 170 classic games, with articles on the leading developers, interviews with key figures in the industry and mini-features on subjects such as packaging, fan art and unreleased games."" -- Provided by publisher.",,,,,,,,,,,536,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780995658608,,1,5.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,2024/08/24 18:43:51.425871968,,,Gaming,,,,,A5vZAQAACAAJ,,0,0,0,,,
